# Kaggle Competition: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

This is a project I've been developing in my free time to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques while participating in the Kaggle competition, *Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets*.  

The goal of this competition is to classify tweets as either related to a real disaster (1) or not (0).
